A terminal simulator with font shadow based on [qmltermwidget](//github.com/Swordfish90/qmltermwidget). I did some dirty hack, because qmltermwidget does not support transparency background currently.

This program is developed for self-usage. The master branch is stable. I am continuously adding features that are useful to myself, but I have no idea what other people need. So these features will not be merged into the master branch.
